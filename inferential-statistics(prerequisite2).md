### Point Estimate:
A single value given as an estimate of a parameter of a population.

As an example of a point estimate, assume you wanted to estimate the mean time it takes 12-year-olds to run 100 yards. The mean running time of a random sample of 12-year-olds would be an estimate of the mean running time for all 12-year-olds. Thus, the sample mean, M, would be a **point estimate** of the population mean, μ.

- The sample standard deviation (s) is a point estimate of the population standard deviation (σ).
- The sample mean (x̅) is a point estimate of the population mean, μ
- The sample variance (s2 is a point estimate of the population variance (σ2).

The estimate occurs as a result of point estimation applied to a set of sample data. Points are single values, in comparison to interval estimates, which are a range of values. For example, a confidence interval is one example of an interval estimate.
